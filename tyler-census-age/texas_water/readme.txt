This archive includes 6 filesets that contain data in ESRI shapefile format. ESRI shapefile is a digital vector storage format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information.

*.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself
*.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly
*.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase III format

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile for more information about ESRI shapefiles.

ArcGIS ( Arc - GIS ) shapefiles are the industry standard and work with most all GIS programs including ESRI ArcView, ArcExplorer, ArcGIS, and Maptitude, Mapinfo, Manifold, Mapwindow, Mapguide and many others.

If you are new to GIS and shapefiles, check www.mapcruzin.com/what-is-gis.htm to learn more. You can use and combine these free shapefiles in various ways with many of our free GIS mapping software programs (www.mapcruzin.com/free-gis-software-tools.htm) and create your own GIS projects. Also, you can use our free Learn2Map Tutorial & Atlas (www.mapcruzin.com/free-learn-to-map-gis-tutorial-and-shapefile-atlas.htm) and included free software.
